  Today we suffer a couple of logging problems in our products:
  <break time="500ms" />
  1. Generate <emphasis>too much</emphasis> logs for L2 support - program call stack <emphasis>can’t help</emphasis> them to troubleshoot field issues.<break time="500ms" />
  2. Developers complaint <emphasis>not enough logs</emphasis> for debugging field issues, if logs are suppressed.<break time="500ms" />
  3. It usually requires <emphasis>advanced skills to perform data-minding</emphasis> on the logs.<break time="500ms" />
  4. Different programs write logs into <emphasis>different locations</emphasis>.<break time="500ms" />
  5. 3rd party component, like NGINX, is part of our product; But it doesn’t write logs meaningful to our domain.<break time="500ms" />
  <break time="3000ms" />
  There are three types of source:
  <break time="500ms" />
  1. 3rd party log files. <break time="500ms" />
  2. Java application using Log4j. <break time="500ms" />
  3. C++ application using Log4cxx. <break time="500ms" />
  <break time="500ms" />
  All these logs are collected by LogStash Agent.<break time="1000ms" />
  Then we have a LogStash server, which provides broking, indexing, storage and searching.<break time="1000ms" />
  LogStash agents forward the logs to the broker, indexer and storage consequently.<break time="1000ms" />
